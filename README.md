# Graviten-Atari-BASIC
Atari BASIC 2016 NOMAM 10-liner programming contest entry. Download the ATR file and play on your favorite emulator (e.g., Altirra).

Inspired by Atari's Gravitar (Red Planet 3 level) and written in 10 lines of TurboBASIC XL.

Pilot your ship around the spiral to the planet's core. Reach the core and advance to the next level. Complete each level quickly to maximize points. But, be careful! Touch the wall and you lose a life.You get five lives per level. Even numbered levels have atmospheric drag (indicated by gray background in the text window) and odd are in vacuum (indicated by black background). Gravity increases every two levels, starting at zero. Play through all 8 levels to complete the mission.  Controls: up to thrust, back to flip, left/right to rotate.
